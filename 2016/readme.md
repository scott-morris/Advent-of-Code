# Advent of Code 2016
### Author: Scott Morris

This year, I wanted to do the challenges using ES6

## TO DO:
### Overall
* Setup `/server` to host solutions, display via browser?
* Change `console.log()` to use `readline`
    - https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html
* Set command line parameter to skip unit tests (for the ones that take a while to finish)
* Separate the problem description from the `js` file to get a better idea of the size of the solution

### Day-Specific
* Day 5 - add "fun animation" to password cracking
