# Advent of Code 2016
### Author: Scott Morris

This year, I wanted to do the challenges using ES6

## TO DO:
### Overall
* Setup `/server` to host solutions, display via browser?
* Create `npm script` to run `index.js` from `--day`
* Unit Testing Updates:
    * Pass options to unit testing function - `title`, `runParallel`?
    * Set command line parameter to skip unit tests (for the ones that take a while to finish)
    * Clean up unit testing logging
    * Pass parameter to unit test functions? Result from previous test (when running in series)?

### Day-Specific
* n/a
