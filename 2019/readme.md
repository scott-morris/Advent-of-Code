# Advent of Code 2019

Every year, I try to use this event as an exercise to learn something new,
not only in the concepts / algorithms that they ask for, but in a technology
stack or toolset.

This year, I'm doing all of my development in TypeScript and testing with Jest.
I've done plenty of reading about the concepts and it's not terribly different
than plain old JavaScript, especially as you get into ES6, but I've always
found that you don't really get a feel for things until you start to use it.

### Running

To run these scripts, you'll need to have `ts-node` installed on your system.

```
cd day01
ts-node index.ts
```

### Testing

Each of the days should at least have tests to cover the examples listed in the
problem description, if not additional tests for debugging / troubleshooting.
To run the tests, you can just run

```
npm test
```
